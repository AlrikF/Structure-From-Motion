		<h1 style="text-align: center;">Assignment 2</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, you will be implementing . 
			<ul>
				<li>Feature Matching</li>
				<li>Structure from Motion</li>
			</ul>
			We have made available a visualization tool using the Three.js library implemented in "./js/assignment2.js" and an example implementation located in "./assignments/assignment2.py". Your objective is to fill in TODOs in the python files and make modification based on it. You are encouraged to use a programming language with which you are comfortable. The output results should be in the ply format, and you must visualize your outcomes accordingly. 
			<br><br>
			<b>How to Submit: </b>Please submit this template file along with your implementation as a zip file. The zip file should contain your source code, the generated results in PLY mesh format, and a report that has been modified using this HTML file. The report should comprise your results and a concise explanation of your implementation. Alternatively, you may choose to create a GitHub repository containing all these elements and provide a link for submission.
			<br><br>
			<b>Requirements / Rubric: </b>The grading is based on the correctness of your implementation. You are encouraged to use the visualization tool to debug your implementation. You can also use the visualization tool to test your implementation on other 3D models. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>+80 pts: Implement the structure-from-motion algorithm with the start code.  </li>
					<li>+20 pts: Write up your project, algorithms, reporting results (reprojection error) and visualisations, compare your reconstruction with open source software Colmap.</li>
					<li>+10 pts: Extra credit (see below)</li>
					<li>-5*n pts: Lose 5 points for every time (after the first) you do not follow the instructions for the hand in format</li>
				</ul>
			<b>Extract Credit:</b> You are free to complete any extra credit:
				<ul>
					<li>up to 5 pts: Present results with your own captured data.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Implement Bundle Adjustment in incremental SFM.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Implement multi-view stereo (dense reconstruction).</li>
					<li>up to 20 pts: Create mobile apps to turn your SFM to a scanner.</li>
					<li>up to 10 pts: Any extra efforts you build on top of basic SFM.</li>
				</ul>

	<h1>Explanation of SFM  Algorithm</h1>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>Extract features (keypoints and descriptors) using the chosen method (e.g., SIFT).</li>
		<li>Serialize and store keypoints and descriptors in pickle files.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Feature Matching:</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>Perform pair  wise feature matching between images.</li>
		<li>Match descriptors using the specified BFMatching Algorithm .</li>
		<li>Sort matches based on their distance.</li>
		<li>Serialize and store matched keypoints in pickle files.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
        <li><strong>Baseline Pose Estimation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The algorithm estimates the initial camera poses (rotation and translation) </li>
                <li>It uses feature matching and epipolar geometry techniques to estimate the fundamental matrix.</li>
                <li>Based on the fundamental matrix, the essential matrix is can be calculated, from which the relative camera poses are recovered.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Triangulation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Triangulation is performed to reconstruct 3D points to matched keypoints.</li>
                <li>The algorithm triangulates the matched keypoints using the known camera poses and intrinsic calibration matrix.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>3D Point Cloud Generation and Reprojection Error Calculation :</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Using the triangulated 3D points, the algorithm generates a 3D point cloud representing the scene.</li>
                <li>It computes the reprojection error for the images, comparing the projected 3D points back to their corresponding 2D keypoints in the images.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pose Estimation, Triangulation, and Reprojection Error Evaluation for Remaining Images:</strong>
            <p>For each subsequent image in the dataset, the algorithm repeats the following steps:</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Results Generation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The algorithm generates a 3D point cloud for each view and stores the results.</li>
                <li>We can also visualize the reprojection errors for each image as PNG or JPG plots.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Results:</strong>
            <p>Once all images are processed, the algorithm calculates the mean reprojection error across all images, providing a measure of the overall quality of the reconstruction.</p>
            <p>It prints out the mean reprojection error and the total execution time, indicating the completion of the reconstruction process.</p>
            <p>Overall, the algorithm iteratively refines the 3D reconstruction of the scene by estimating camera poses, triangulating new points, and evaluating the quality of the reconstruction through reprojection error analysis.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
	
	<h1>Comparison with Colmap Results</h1>
	<p>For comparison, I have also run the same dataset through the open-source SFM software Colmap. The results are visualized below for comparison with the results generated by implemented algorithm. 
		Colmap seems to give slightly better results  </p>
